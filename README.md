> The package manager for Xanites modular ecosystem.

XPM (based on [apm][apm]) is built on top of [pnpm][pnpm] to make use
of its speed and flat file structure for dependencies. XPM uses GitHub as
a registry instead of [npmjs.com][npm-website], all while ensuring native modules
are built against Chromium's v8 headers.

This README along with the project is a work in progress.
